Its been about three months since I've started working from home! It seems that the Covid-19 situation in Singapore is stabalising, which is really awesome.

The past three months have been challenging in its own way. Unlike any other time before this, most of us experienced social isolation of a different level. Even as an introvert, interacting with friends over online games or zoom meetings required some time to get used to. Furthermore, as the semester ended in May, I started to have more time on my hands, at least until the next semester starts. 

And with that much time on my hands, I wanted to develop some routines that I could do on a daily or bi-daily basis. These were things or steps that I would try to accomplish on a routinely basis, in hope of gaining some sort of momentum. So far, the routines have worked really well for me, and I can really feel improvements in myself that I was seeking.

The past two months I have been intensively practicing on LC and Pramp during my free time. Since I have never really prepared for something like this before, it was initially really difficult for me to multitask (Coding, explaining, thinking) at the same time. Several attempts made me feel that I was rushing through my thought process. Slowly but surely, I managed to pace myself even when I did not know the solutions to certain problems. Pramp does not really have rigorous test cases like LC, but the ability to practice with peers in real life, allowed me to not only step out of my comfort zone, but also pick up certain good habits that these excellent peers had.

During the same period of time, I started to run once every two days. It was initially just an initiative to exercise and get some sunlight outside the comfort of my home. At a certain point, I started to realise that this would be a great chance to gradually build up some stamina ( and maybe prepare for the next IPPT cycle ). Ever since my ORD, my timings for my 2.4km runs have started to worsen by the year. It was something that I felt was not that important and its inevitable that we slowly get less fit as we age. After a few weeks into my routine, I realised that I started to ache less, and I also felt less fatigued. As of today, I managed to shave off 2 minutes for my 2.4km run!

Having started these routines, I had certain expetations for improvement. That is kind of normal I guess? But even with a ton of hard work put into something, sometimes things don't go your way. For example. I might have felt confident in various LC topics but certain circumstances can unfortunately still happen. I can try my best for today's run, and still do worse than how I did two days ago. Without routines, these small setbacks might seem huge. But if I know that the hardwork I'm are putting in is for the long term, I know that I'm already an improvement of myself two months ago. And thats enough for me!
