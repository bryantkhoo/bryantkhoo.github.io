Hello! Whelp, towards the end of 2019 there were so many things happening at the same time, that I totally neglected the blog.

This semester I will be taking up two modules which are Neural Networks & Deep Learning and Information Visualization. Information Visualization might seem like an odd choice, but I do think it can be a really beneficial module to take! As a software engineer, I noticed that from a technical standpoint, it is often easy to forget about the significance of the meaning behind the data. Hopefully opportunities will arise for me to practice story telling with the help of visualizations that we build in the course of the semester! Looking forward to practicing some vis-skills with D3 and Tableau too.

I happened to also start my rotation to a new team in November. We started on a project partnering with Engineers from Microsoft to build search application on Microsoft Azure. So far, the whole experience has been more than ideal! It has been such a fulfilling journey over the past few sprints. It has been a pleasure coding along side likeminded experts! Upon reflection, I realise now that its not only the technical accomplishments that give me the sense of satisfaction from my job, it is mainly the chance to collaborate with amazing people that makes this job fun. Communication really is key huh?

At this rate, I'm really looking forward to what's coming up in 2020. I'll provide more updates soon!
