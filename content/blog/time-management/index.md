I'm going to penning down my thoughts today on time management!

The past 3 weeks have really been hectic, juggling work, school and my volunteering duties. At work, I was spending most of my time preparing for my move to a new team. On a daily basis, I was implementing and testing last minute requirements that were given to me, 3 weeks before my move. And I was also documenting and explaining to my stakeholders on how the application I built works.

With school work, I have been working on multiple assignments on and off, and often prioritising those that are nearing their deadlines first. There is definitely still plenty of room for improvement, as I have been neglecting some of these projects. ( I'm frantically catching up on those that I have neglected ) I have been pondering on I could be utilizing my time better, especially since I'm spending at least 8 hours of my day in the office.

I toyed around with a two strategies, mainly waking up early and working on school related stuff before going to work, and reading materials on the way to work.

Waking up earlier does feel great. It gives me that extra one to two hours to catch up on something, or to do some sort of revision. I usually find it hard to get into the zone to deep dive into an assignment in the morning! But it does seems to be the perfect time to be watching a webcast for example.

Reading school materials on commute is usually a challenge. On the train to work, I usually get distracted quite easily by my surrounding environment. It gets worse when I try to read on the bus, on the way to NUS. (Weak me tends to get motion sickness lol)

Having much lesser time, during this period of time did get me thinking about my priorities ( In somewhat a particular order ):
1. Spending time with my loved ones
2. Work, and getting things done
3. School work
4. Preparing for Code in the Community sessions

Over the past 2 months or so, some of the things that I had to forgo were:
1. Spending time with friends. ( My weekly Mahjong nights for example :P )
2. Reading. I really miss reading.
    * Really looking forward to reading again once exam ends!
    * Technically I should be able to find time to read, but it does not feel good reading when I know there are materials I should be reading..
3. Hobby stuff like watercolor and Netflixing

Yup, in summary I think there is still room for improvement in terms of time management, and I really never thought this would be easy! Optimistically thinking, these busy periods come in bursts of 2-3 months every semester which happens twice a year. Its really a hectic period, but I believe this experience will allow me cultivate the important skill of time management.

Time to go back to doing assignments lah.
