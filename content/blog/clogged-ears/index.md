"How to listen in a noisy world", heh that's like some ultimate click bait material.

Anyway, my ears really felt clogged up recently. It literally felt that way! I could not even hear what my boss was saying at times, but I think i managed somehow.

I'm not sure what helped, but I immediately went for a swim upon reaching home.

You know that feeling when you breathe, and you hear the air moving along with something in your ears? Yup, sounds gross and it absolutely is.

Okay, I'm not sounding like my usual self in this post, and it might be the excess caffeine kicking in. And maybe I'm starting to go abit cray.
