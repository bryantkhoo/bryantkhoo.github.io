This blogpost is going to be a brief recount of recent experiences and events!

Some time back, a friend and colleague of mine at work reached out to me for assistance. He was tasked to organise a 10 week volunteering session in collaboration with Code in the Community (CITC), and was looking for someone keen on being the instructor. Teaching a class of kids did seem intimidating to me, but I agreed to help out anyway. Boy, it has been one of the best decision I have made in the recent past. I cannot say for sure that everything will go as expected or smoothly (as usual), but I believe that the experiences over the next 2 months will justify my decision.

For the last couple of weeks, I have been helping out with CITC sessions at a nearby public library. Lessons are two hours long, and kids aged between 7 and 12 are exposed to computational thinking through the Scratch programming platform. The instructor leading the class is really experienced, and I do have alot to learn from him. 

His success in keeping the kids engaged is probably due to the following:
* Being ready for class. This by no means simply mean understanding the content! It involves looking through every detail of the content, and masterfully pinpointing potential pitfalls. Are some of the concepts or words in the slides that are ambiguous?
* Being experienced with class management. Teaching someone one-to-one is significantly different from teaching a class of kids. It is important to continuously notice group dynamics and make changes if necessary.
* Being able to strike a balance between being fun and being stern. Kids love to have fun. But things can quickly get out of hand in class and get rowdy.
* Being good looking. (Just kidding! HAHA) I think its important to maintain your composure even when unexpected things happen, and defintely ALWAYS SMILE.

With the above points in mind, I prepared for my lesson for last week.

It was a blast!

The class was rowdy. In fact, I think it could potentially be the most rowdy CITC class in history. I could tell all the volunteers were taken aback initially. The initially thirty minutes was tough. Account creation was a boring task, and it was hard to keep the students engaged in what was happening.

However, things gradually took a turn for the better once lessons began! Though I was also learning on the job, picking up small tricks and tips from others really helped here. Based on my observation, roughly 90% of the students were genuinely interested, and were engaged in building up their own projects on scratch.

Look at [this project](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/327301941/) done by one of my students! 

As of now I'm really looking forward to future lessons, despite how challenging they might be.
