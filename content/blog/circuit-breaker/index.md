This week marks the sixth week of me working from home. My team decided to work from home before the Circuit Breaker started in Singapore, so far working from home has transitioned pretty well. From a infrastructure perspective, the company that I'm working at has been working tirelessly to ramp up the capacity for work from home individuals. In fact, around 85,000 of the 95,000 staff globally has transitioned to working from home. It really is a blessing to be able to work from home. However, this does not apply to all industries and jobs. Of these industries, the tourism and hospitality industries have been hit the hardest. Over the past weeks, it is evident that the F&B industry is struggling, with majority of owners only having 20% of the sales they had before the pandemic. The effects of the virus is probably still not at its peak, and surely many more industries have started to face these effects. Hopefully with everyone's efforts the Singapore Government can contain the cases.

My second semester an NUS officially ended last week. With additional time on my hands now due to the circuit breaker, I feel compelled to pick up more projects to work on, and to improve myself.

Since my last project submission for the semester, I have started working on Leetcode problems quite religiously, and so far I have also practiced a little bit on PRAMP. Overall my experience on PRAMP has been positive, and so far I have been matched with like-minded individuals that strive to improve themselves. I hope to continue exposing myself to a larger variety of questions and continue improving my currently subpar communication skills in such a setting. My biggest takeaway so far is that it is not that easy to be the interviewer. Its quite hard to understand what the candidate is thinking and try to guide them towards the ideal solution without giving them too much help.

Some of the things that I have started working on over the past week and stuff that I intend to kick start are the following:

* Work on Leetcode questions
* PRAMP
* Take part in a Kaggle Competition
* Deploy a ML model

Really want to stay motivated for the rest the circuit breaker!

Also I hope to make more updates here on questions that I encountered on PRAMP. Until then!
