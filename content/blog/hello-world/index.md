It been awhile since I last blogged! 2019 so far has been full of surprises, with more downs than ups so far. Nonetheless, like how the waves continue to roll with the moon, we shall persist!

School officially starts tomorrow. I will be attempting to juggle work from my full time job as a software engineer and as a MComp student in NUS. With the new blog, I intend to document my upcoming experiences in NUS and work. Stay tuned for more!
