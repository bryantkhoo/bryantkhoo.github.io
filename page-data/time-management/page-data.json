At work, I was spending most of my time preparing for my move to a new team. On a daily basis, I was implementing and testing last minute requirements that were given to me, 3 weeks before my move. And I was also documenting and explaining to my stakeholders on how the application I built works.</p>\n<p>With school work, I have been working on multiple assignments on and off, and often prioritising those that are nearing their deadlines first. There is definitely still plenty of room for improvement, as I have been neglecting some of these projects. ( I'm frantically catching up on those that I have neglected ) I have been pondering on I could be utilizing my time better, especially since I'm spending at least 8 hours of my day in the office.</p>\n<p>I toyed around with a two strategies, mainly waking up early and working on school related stuff before going to work, and reading materials on the way to work.</p>\n<p>Waking up earlier does feel great. It gives me that extra one to two hours to catch up on something, or to do some sort of revision. I usually find it hard to get into the zone to deep dive into an assignment in the morning! But it does seems to be the perfect time to be watching a webcast for example.</p>\n<p>Reading school materials on commute is usually a challenge. On the train to work, I usually get distracted quite easily by my surrounding environment. It gets worse when I try to read on the bus, on the way to NUS. (Weak me tends to get motion sickness lol)</p>\n<p>Having much lesser time, during this period of time did get me thinking about my priorities ( In somewhat a particular order ):</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Spending time with my loved ones</li>\n<li>Work, and getting things done</li>\n<li>School work</li>\n<li>Preparing for Code in the Community sessions</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Over the past 2 months or so, some of the things that I had to forgo were:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Spending time with friends. ( My weekly Mahjong nights for example :P )</li>\n<li>\n<p>Reading. I really miss reading.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Really looking forward to reading again once exam ends!</li>\n<li>Technically I should be able to find time to read, but it does not feel good reading when I know there are materials I should be reading..</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Hobby stuff like watercolor and Netflixing</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Yup, in summary I think there is still room for improvement in terms of time management, and I really never thought this would be easy! Optimistically thinking, these busy periods come in bursts of 2-3 months every semester which happens twice a year. Its really a hectic period, but I believe this experience will allow me cultivate the important skill of time management.</p>\n<p>Time to go back to doing assignments lah.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Time Management","date":"October 26, 2019","description":"Whilst studying part time"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/time-management/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/first-lesson-as-teacher/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Firsts"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/hello-2020/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Hello 2020"}}}}}
